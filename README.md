# Code Snippets
This section of code is important because it sets the requirements for the password to generate from the user's choices.

 if (pwLength < 8 || pwLength > 128 (parseInt(pwLength))) {
    alert("Enter a number between 8 and 128.");
  }
  else {
    var LC = confirm("Would you like to use lowecase letters?");
    if(LC) {
      allChar += lowercase
    };
    var UC = confirm("Would you like to use uppercase?");
    if(UC) {
      allChar += uppercase
    };
    var specChar = confirm("Would you like to use speical characters?");
    if (specChar) {
      allChar += specialChar
    };
    var num = confirm("Would you like to use numbers?");
    if (num) {
      allChar += numbers

# Learning Points
 - One of the things I learned from this homework assignment is that indentation is important. I learned the hard way that if you dont ident and space out your code it can be confusing to read for you and the other developer.
 - learned what isNaN mean and parseInt
